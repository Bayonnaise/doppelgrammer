Objectives
---

With a decent grounding in Rails, this week introduced images and the use of Amazon Web Services. We were to build an Instragram-style site for uploading and rating images. I paired with [Charlotte Kelly](https://github.com/cmew3) for the whole week, and we veered away from a straight Instagram clone in favour of a lookalikes theme with pairs of uploaded images. The result is [Doppelgrammer](http://doppelgrammer.herokuapp.com/).

New concepts
---

- Uploading and processing images using Paperclip, hosting via Amazon S3
- Managing secret information (e.g. private keys)
- Many-to-many relationships in Rails (with tagging)
- Geocoding with Google Maps
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Creating APIs using Rails + jBuilder
